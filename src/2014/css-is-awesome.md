![CSS is awesome!](http://madrse.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/104-mug.jpg)

Äntligen har jag rätt kaffemugg för rätt jobb. Som en hyllning till klassiker som [Behind Blue Es][1], [We don't need another App Store][2], [IE and life][3] och [Fuck IE gently][4] kommer här en modifierad låttext för ökad effekt.

Texten är en förbättrad version av [Everything is Awesome från LEGO: The Movie][5], som också finns på [Spotify][6].

> CSS is awesome  
CSS is cool when you're part of a team  
CSS is awesome when we're writing our dream  
CSS is better when we code together  
Side by side, you and I gonna win forever, let's write code forever  
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all working in harmony

> Have you heard the news, everyone's talking  
Life is good 'cause CSS's awesome  
Lost my job, it's a new opportunity  
More free time for my awesome community  
>
> I feel more awesome than an awesome possum  
Dip my body in browser frostin'  
Three years later, still got the frostin'  
Smellin' like a blossom, CSS is awesome  
Stepped in mud, got new blue E:s  
It's awesome to win, and it's awesome to lose
>
> CSS is better when we dread together  
Side by side, you and I, gonna win forever, let's write code forever  
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all coding in harmony

CSS is awesome when we're living our dream  
>
>Blue E:s, bouncy panes
We just named two awesome things  
Design prize, colors in hex  
You know what's awesome? CSS!
>
>Chrome with fleas, allergies,  
A book of Web antiquities  
Brand new tools, a very old vest  
Websafe colors are the best  
>
>EMs, percent, and calc()  
They're awesome  
grids, widths, and heights  
They're awesome  
bold, transforms, and hex  
That's awesome  
CSS you see, or write, or say  
Is awesome

CSS is awesome when we're coding our dream

> **Everything needs to be fucking simpler.**
>
> This manifests itself in a number of ways, none more apparent to me
> than in interface and product design. Consider how many successful
> products you use that focus on one amazing *thing*: Byword, Dropbox,
> Rdio, Uber. All these products and their interfaces are the result of
> paring down an idea to only the most essential. People love this
> stuff.
>
> We want---need?---fewer, higher quality *things* in our lives. We
> crave simpler at every turn. As designers we can provide that.

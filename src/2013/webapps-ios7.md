Oerhört ambitiöst arbete är tillgängligt för läsning på [How to create a web app that looks like a iOS7 native app](http://mir.aculo.us/2013/09/16/how-to-create-a-web-app-that-looks-like-a-ios7-native-app-part-1/).

> So you want to create a mobile web app that doesn’t look like it’s from 2007 and loads fast to boot with, ideally looking and working just like a native app.

> Now you might heave heard that Facebook famously switched to a native app citing performance concerns. However, you’re probably not Facebook and pushing terabytes of data around—most mobile apps just display some data and provide a way to input data (mostly just text) and that’s about it. Web apps do a great job, and you don’t have to develop a native app for each platform you want to support. Plus, you get to use skills you already have.

> There’s three main areas that making a “native-like” mobile web app can be broken down to:

> * Styling, specifically typography, hairlines, transparencies and animations
* Behavior, including saving the web app to the home screen, making the status bar “part” of the app and reacting to on/offline events, and fast-loading
* Cross-device compatibility, so the app runs on Android and other devices as well
